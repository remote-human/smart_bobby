To use voice recognition you have to import unity package first in unity by clicking Assets->Import Package->Custom Package and then
search for UnityExample.unitypackage.

To use and edit android source code simply open Android Source Code folder in Android Studio and you can edit files there.
When you finish editing just select Gradle tab from the right side of Android Studio window and go to Build->Assemble and 
your file will be generated as aar inside build/outputs/aar folder where Android Project is located(in this case inside folder "Android
Source Code/build/outputs/aar") then rename the .aar to .zip and extract it and you will get classes.jar and AndroidManifest.xml
file . Simply copy those two files and put them in Unity's Assets/Plugin/Android folder of your project and replace other two to test it.
